    "this board.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Acknowledgements:_ These notes heavely relied on the following earlier, very helpful resources:\n",
    "- Installation:  \n",
    "  - https://lemariva.com/blog/2017/10/micropython-getting-started  \n",

    "### Setting up MicroPython on the ESP32 under Windows 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install USB to Serial driver for the ESP32:  \n",
    "    [Download driver here](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Restart computer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Update pip and install some tools:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "   pip install msgpack\n",
    "   pip install esptool\n",
    "   pip install adafruit-ampy\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Download the latest Micropython software binary for ESP32:  \n",
    "    [Download firmware here](https://micropython.org/download/#esp32)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Connect the device to the PC using an USB cable, and check the serial\n",
    "   interface number where the ESP32 is connected (e.g. COM5).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In a (power)shell, erase the flash of the ESP32, with `<xx>` indicating\n",
    "   the current COM port and `<yyy>` the name of the firmware file.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m esptool --port COM<xx> erase_flash\n",
    "   python -m esptool --port COM<xx> --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_mode  dio --flash_size=detect 0x1000 <yyy>.bin\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Now you should be ready to go. Start a terminal program (e.g. PuTTY) and \n",
    "   connect to the COM port (at 115200 BAUD). You should see the chevrons \n",
    "   (`>>>`) of the [REPL prompt](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/repl.html),\n",
    "   indicating that the device is ready. Try something like \n",
    "   `print(\"Hello\")` to see if the device responds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "8. In a powershell (or bash), use the tool `ampy` (in a powershell or bash)\n",
    "   to manipulate files on the ESP32. See https://github.com/adafruit/ampy for details.\n",
    "   For example, copy a python file to the flash of the ESP32 using:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ampy --port COM<xx> put <pythonfilename>.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   List the files in the ESP32's flash memory:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ampy --port COM<xx> ls\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   View a file in the flash:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ampy --port COM<xx> get <filename>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Remove a file from the flash:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ampy --port COM<xx> rm <filename>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Set default COM port to use shorter commands:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   $env:AMPY_PORT = 'COM<xx>'\n",
    "   ampy ls\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   _Note:_ In principle, similar commands ae also available from a jupyter \n",
    "   notebook connected to a python kernel running on the device (see below, \n",
    "   and see `%lsmagic` for commands), but I could not get them to work reliably.\n",

    "### Using Atom to interact with MicroPython on an ESP32\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pymakr` plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/) allows to interact with a \n",
    "ESP32 via the REPL. In addition, one can also use it to upload all files of \n",
    "a project (in a specified folder) or run individual `.py` files directly.\n",

    "   ```\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install -e jupyter_micropython_kernel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates a small file pointing to this directory in the `python/../site-packages directory`, \n",
    "   and makes it possible to `git update` the library later as it gets improved. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "3. Install the kernel into jupyter itself using:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m jupyter_micropython_kernel.install\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates the small file `.local/share/jupyter/kernels/micropython/kernel.json` \n",
    "   that jupyter uses to reference its kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now run Jupyter notebooks:\n",
